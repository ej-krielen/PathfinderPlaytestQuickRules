    <string name="title_aid">Aid - reaction</string>
    <string name="text_aid">
Trigger An ally is about to use an action, activity, free action, or reaction that requires a skill check.\n Requirements The ally is willing to accept your aid, and you have prepared to help (see below). You try to aid your ally’s check in some way. To use this reaction, you must first prepare to help, usually by using an action during your turn. You must explain to the GM exactly how you’re trying to help, and she determines whether you can Aid your ally. When you use your Aid reaction, attempt a skill check of a type decided by the GM. The typical DC for Aid is 15, but at the GM’s discretion this might change to DC 20 for particularly hard tasks or DC 10 for particularly easy tasks. The GM can add any relevant traits to your Aid reaction or to your preparatory action depending on the situation. \n Success You grant your ally a +2 circumstance bonus to the triggering skill check.\n Critical Success You grant your ally a +4 circumstance bonus to the triggering skill check.\n Critical Failure Your ally takes a –2 circumstance penalty to the triggering skill check.

    <string name="title_assist">Assist - action</string>
    <string name="requirement_assist">An enemy is within your melee reach, and is within the reach of one or more of your allies.</string>
    <string name="text_assist">
You help an ally attack the enemy or foil the enemy’s attacks against one of your allies. Choose one enemy you’re adjacent to and one ally adjacent to that enemy. Then, attempt a melee attack against the enemy’s AC.\n Success The creature takes no damage. Instead, you either impose a –2 circumstance penalty to the enemy’s attack rolls against your chosen ally, or you grant your chosen ally a +2 circumstance bonus to attack rolls against your chosen enemy. You choose which effect you create. The penalty or bonus lasts until the start of your next turn.\n Critical Success As a success, but the penalty is –4 or the bonus is +4.\n Critical Failure Your chosen enemy either gains a +2 circumstance bonus to attack rolls against your chosen ally or your chosen ally takes a –2 penalty to attack rolls against the chosen enemy. Your chosen enemy decides which of these effects occurs. The penalty or bonus lasts until the start of your next turn.

    <string name="title_crawl">Crawl - action</string>
    <string name="requirement_crawl">You are prone and your Speed is at least 10 feet.</string>
    <string name="text_crawl">You move 5 feet.</string>

    <string name="title_delay">Delay - free action</string>
    <string name="trigger_delay">Your turn begins.</string>
    <string name="text_delay">
You bide your time, waiting for the right moment to act. The rest of your turn doesn’t happen yet. Instead, you’re removed from the initiative order. You can return to the initiative order as a free action triggered by the end of any other creature’s turn. This permanently changes your initiative to the new position. You can’t use reactions until you return to the initiative order. If you Delay an entire round without returning to the initiative order, the actions from the Delayed turn are lost, your initiative doesn’t change, and your next turn occurs at your original position in the initiative order. When you Delay, any persistent damage or other negative effects that you would have normally taken at the start or end of your turn occur immediately when you use the Delay action. Any beneficial effects that would end at any point during your turn also end at this point. The GM might determine that other effects end when you Delay as well. Essentially, you can’t Delay to avoid negative consequences that would happen on your turn or to extend beneficial effects that would end on your turn.

    <string name="title_drop">Drop - free action</string>
    <string name="trigger_drop">Your turn begins, your turn ends, or you start to use an action.</string>
    <string name="text_drop">
You drop an item you’re holding in your hand or hands, or release your grip from one hand while continuing to hold it in the other. Unlike most manipulate actions, Drop does not trigger reactions such as Attack of Opportunity.
</string>

    <string name="title_drop_prone">Drop prone - 1 action</string>
    <string name="text_drop_prone">You fall prone. </string>

    <string name="title_interact">Interact - 1 action</string>
    <string name="text_interact">
You use your hand or hands to manipulate an object or the terrain. You grab an unattended or stored object, open a door, or do some similar action. You may have to attempt a skill check to determine if your Interact action was successful.
</string>

    <string name="title_leap">Leap - 1 action</string>
    <string name="text_leap">
You take a careful but short jump. You can Leap up to 10 feet horizontally if your Speed is at least 15 feet, or up to 15 feet horizontally if your Speed is at least 30 feet. You land in the space where your Leap ends (meaning you can typically clear a 5-foot gap if your Speed is between 15 feet and 30 feet, or a 10-foot gap if your Speed is 30 feet or more). If you make a vertical Leap, you can move up to 3 feet vertically and 5 feet horizontally onto an elevated surface. Jumping a greater distance requires using the Athletics skill (see pages 146-147).
</string>

    <string name="title_ready">Ready - 2 actions</string>
    <string name="text_ready">
You prepare to use an action that will occur outside your turn. Choose a single action you can use and designate a trigger. Your turn then ends. If the trigger you choose occurs before the start of your next turn, you can use the chosen action as a reaction (provided you still meet the requirements to use it).If you have a multiple attack penalty and your readied action is an attack action, your readied attack takes the multiple attack penalty as if you had spent your readied attack on your turn. This is one of the few times the multiple attack penalty applies when it’s not your turn. For more information about multiple attack penalties, see page 305.
</string>

    <string name="title_seek">Seek - 1 action</string>
    <string name="text_seek">
You scan an area for signs of unseen creatures or hidden objects. If you’re scanning for signs of unseen creatures, choose either a 30-foot cone or a 15-foot burst within line of sight. The GM attempts a single secret Perception check (see page 293) for you and compares the result to the Stealth DCs of any unseen creatures within the area. If your result is greater than the Stealth DC of a creature, you sense the creature until it Sneaks (see page 158) or otherwise avoids your detection (see Senses on page 301). If you’re using Seek to search for hidden objects such as secret doors or hazards, you search up to a 10-foot square adjacent to you. You may need to spend more than 1 Seek action for larger areas or if the area to be searched is cluttered. If your Perception check result equals or exceeds the DC of a hidden object (as determined by the GM or by the character Concealing the Object), you either learn its location or gain a clue as to its location (GM’s choice).
</string>

    <string name="title_stand">Stand - 1 action</string>
    <string name="text_stand">You stand up from prone. </string>

    <string name="title_step">Step - 1 action</string>
    <string name="requirement_step">Your Speed is at least 10 feet.</string>
    <string name="text_step">
You carefully move 5 feet. Unlike most types of movement, Stepping doesn’t trigger reactions, such as Attacks of Opportunity, based on move actions or on leaving or entering a square. You can’t Step into difficult terrain or greater difficult terrain (see page 312).
</string>

    <string name="title_stride">Stride - 1 action</string>
    <string name="text_stride">Move up to your Speed (see page 310). </string>

    <string name="title_strike">Strike - 1 action</string>
    <string name="text_strike">
You attack with a weapon you’re wielding or with an unarmed attack, targeting one creature within your reach (for a melee attack) or within range (for a ranged attack). Roll the attack roll for the weapon or unarmed attack you are using and compare the result to the target creature’s AC to determine the effect. See Melee Strikes and Ranged Strikes on page 17 for details on calculating your attack and damage rolls.\n Success You deal damage according to the weapon or unarmed attack, including any circumstance and conditional bonuses and penalties.\n Critical Success You critically succeed at an attack roll, dealing double damage.
</string>
    <string name="title_take_cover">Take cover - 1 action</string>
    <string name="requirement_take_cover">You are benefiting from cover or are near a feature that allows you to take cover.</string>
    <string name="text_take_cover">
You press yourself against a wall or duck behind an obstacle to take better advantage of cover (see Cover on page 314). If you would gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC and Reflex saves due to cover, you instead gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC and Reflex saves from the cover while you’re taking cover. Otherwise, you gain the normal benefits of cover. This lasts until you move from your current space, use an attack action, become unconscious, or end this effect as a free action triggered by the start or end of your turn.
